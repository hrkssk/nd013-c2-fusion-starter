# Final Project
## Project overview
The final project consists of four main steps:<br>

    Step 1: Implement an extended Kalman filter.<br>
    Step 2: Implement track management including track state and track score, track initialization and deletion.<br>
    Step 3: Implement single nearest neighbour data association and gating.<br>
    Step 4: Apply sensor fusion by implementing the nonlinear camera measurement model and a sensor visibility check.<br>

## Step 1: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
I implemented an EKF in the "filter.py"
These images are the result of tracking and RMSE.

## Step 2: Track Management

## Step 3: Data Association and Gating

## Step 4: Sensor Fusion
